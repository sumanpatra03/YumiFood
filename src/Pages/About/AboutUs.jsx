                Launched in 2010, our technology platform connects customers,
                restaurant partners, and delivery partners, serving their
                multiple needs. Customers use our platform to search and
                discover restaurants, read and write customer-generated reviews
                and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table,
                and make payments while dining out at restaurants.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with
                industry-specific marketing tools that enable them to engage and
                acquire customers to grow their business while also providing a
                reliable and efficient last-mile delivery service. We also
                operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which
                supplies high-quality ingredients and kitchen products to
                restaurant partners. We also provide our delivery partners with
                transparent and flexible earning opportunities.
